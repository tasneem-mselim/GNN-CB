# GNN-CB: A Graph Neural Network Competition Benchmark


Welcome to the official repository for the paper **"GNN-CB: A Graph Neural Network Competition Benchmark for Human and LLM Evaluation"**. GNN-CB is the **first competition-based benchmark** designed to evaluate both humans and large language models (LLMs) on graph neural network (GNN) coding tasks under controlled, reproducible competition settings.

## 📖 Introduction

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are central to modern graph machine learning, yet no benchmark has systematically evaluated whether LLMs can autonomously solve realistic **end-to-end GNN coding tasks**. GNN-CB bridges this gap.

**Key features:**

- **18 curated competitions** spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level prediction across 7 graph categories and 4 difficulty tiers.
- **Unified hidden-test evaluation pipeline** via automated GitHub Actions — identical conditions for all human and LLM submissions.
- **Three complementary protocols:** competition design, controlled human evaluation, and frozen-prompt LLM evaluation with bounded execute-and-repair loops.
- **Two LLM evaluation modes:** API-only non-agent and autonomous agent-based, supporting both proprietary and open-source models.
- **Living benchmark:** dynamic leaderboards, reproducible pipelines, and an open submission infrastructure.

## 👥 Human Evaluation Protocol

Human participants solve each competition under the following standardized constraints:

| Constraint | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Architecture** | GNN only (no CNN, RNN, or Transformers) |
| **Compute budget** | 3 CPU hours per task |
| **Random seed** | Fixed at `seed=25` |
| **Submissions** | 1 final submission per competition |
| **HP tuning runs** | ≤ 5 |
| **LLM assistance** | Low-level utility only; no task-specific context |

Each participant maintains a documentation log recording: hyperparameter search strategy, all configurations attempted, training time, hardware specs, and any LLM-assisted snippets. Prediction files are encrypted locally before upload via pull-request to prevent information leakage.

## 📊 Results Summary

**Human performance** exhibits substantial variability across tasks:
- Easy tasks (C03, C08, C14): high scores with low variance — participants reliably implement standard GNN pipelines.
- Hard tasks (C02, C04, C11, C18): lower averages and larger best–worst gaps — sensitive to architectural choices and optimization quality.

**LLM performance** stratifies clearly by difficulty:
- On Easy competitions, frontier models approach or match human top (e.g., Claude Opus 4.7 reaches 0.998 on C08).
- On Medium and Hard tasks, sizeable gaps persist (0.05–0.40 below human top).
- The **Best–Mean gap** (26–44 pp) indicates that no model reliably sustains its peak performance across diverse tasks.
- Two LLMs exceed human top on specific tasks: Kimi k2.6 on C09 GraphFMD (+0.153) and GPT-5.4 Codex on C13 GTA (+0.036).
